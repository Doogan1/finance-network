# Dynamic Financial Network Visualizer - Project Status

## Completed
- Basic Django project structure
- Core models (Node, Edge, Transaction)
- API endpoints and serializers
- Simulation engine foundation
- Initial test suite

## Current Task
Fixing test suite issues:
- Error in simulation test comparing naive and timezone-aware datetimes
- Need to update simulation engine to handle timezone-aware dates consistently

## Next Steps
1. Fix timezone handling in simulation engine
2. Complete backend testing
3. Start frontend development:
   - Set up React project structure
   - Create basic network visualization with D3.js
   - Implement interactive node/edge creation
4. Add time-based simulation features
5. Implement data import/export
6. Add user authentication and security features

## Future Considerations
- Data validation and error handling
- Performance optimization for large networks
- Real-time updates
- Mobile responsiveness
